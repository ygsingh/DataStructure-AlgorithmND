# Data Structures & Algorithms

In this program, you will learn data structures and algorithms by solving 100+ practice problems. You will begin each course by learning to solve defined problems related to a particular data structure & algorithm.

## Course 1: Introduction
Get an overview of your program. Meet your instructors, and refresh your python skills. Learn the framework to deconstruct any open-ended problem and then understand the concepts of time and space complexity, essential tools for evaluating different data structure & algorithms.

- Lesson 2: Recursion
- Lesson 3: Trees
- Lesson 4: Maps and Hashing

_Sample Practice Problems_: Reverse Strings, Hamming Distance, Reverse a Linked List, Linked List Loop Detection, Balancing Brackets, Building Queue using Stacks, Tree Traversals, Checking Binary Search Tree, String Key Hash table

### Project 2: Show Me the Data Structures
Solve a series of open-ended practice problems such as LRU Cache, Private Blockchain, File Recursion and many more. Hone your skills to identify and implement appropriate data structures and corresponding methods which meet given constraints.

## Course 3: Basic Algorithms
Learn and implement basic algorithms such as searching and sorting on different data structures and examine the efficiency of these algorithms. Use recursion to implement these algorithms and then learn how some of these algorithms can be implemented without recursion. Practice selecting and modifying these algorithms for a variety of interview problems.
- Lesson 1: Binary Search
- Lesson 2: Sorting Algorithms
- Lesson 3: Divide & Conquer Algorithms

_Sample Practice Problems_: Randomized Binary Search, K-smallest elements using Heaps, Build Red-Black Tree, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, sorting strings, Linear-time median finding
### Project 3: Problems vs. Algorithms
A series of real-world open ended problems such as request routing for web server, search-term auto-completion and Fibonacci heap which train you to apply suitable data structures and algorithms under different context.

## Course 4: Advanced Algorithms
Build on your algorithm skills by learning more advanced algorithms such as brute-force greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming, which optimizes recursion by storing results to sub problems.
- Lesson 1: Greedy Algorithms
- Lesson 2: Graph Algorithms
- Lesson 3: Dynamic Programming
- Lesson 4: Linear Programming

_Sample Practice Problems_: Graph Traversals, Diijkstra's Algorithm, Shortest Hops, A* Search, Longest Palindromic subsequence, web crawler

### Project 4: Route Planner
In this project, you will build a route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map. You will first select and implement appropriate data-structure to represent points on a map and then implement the A* algorithm to find shortest path.
